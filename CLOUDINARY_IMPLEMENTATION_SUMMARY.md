# Cloudinary Upload Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Implementation:** Complete ✅  
**Source:** `backRef` project  
**Target:** `backend` project

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ Cloudinary Utility Functions (`src/utils/cloudinary.ts`)

**Features:**

- `deleteImage(publicId)` - Delete single image from Cloudinary
- `deleteMultipleImages(publicIds)` - Delete multiple images with Promise.allSettled
- `uploadBuffer(fileBuffer, options)` - Upload file buffer to Cloudinary
- `uploadBase64(base64Image, options)` - Upload base64 encoded images
- `getResourceDetails(publicId)` - Get resource information
- `listResources(folderPath, options)` - List resources in a folder

**Key Features:**

- 60-second timeout protection
- Error handling and logging
- Stream-based uploads for memory efficiency
- Flexible configuration options

---

### 2. ✅ Upload Controller (`src/api/uploads/upload.controller.ts`)

**Endpoints Implemented:**

- `uploadFile` - Single file upload
- `uploadMultipleFiles` - Multiple file upload (up to 10)
- `uploadBase64Image` - Base64 image upload
- `deleteFile` - Delete file from Cloudinary
- `getFileInfo` - Get file information

**Features:**

- Type-based folder organization
- Date and timestamp in filenames
- Sequential upload for multiple files
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed response metadata

---

### 3. ✅ Upload Routes (`src/routes/uploads.route.ts`)

**Routes Created:**

| Method | Endpoint                      | Auth     | Description          |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | -------- | -------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/uploads`                | Optional | Single file upload   |
| POST   | `/api/uploads/base64`         | Optional | Base64 image upload  |
| POST   | `/api/uploads/multiple`       | Required | Multiple file upload |
| POST   | `/api/uploads/document`       | Required | Document upload      |
| POST   | `/api/uploads/application`    | Required | Application docs     |
| DELETE | `/api/uploads/:publicId`      | Required | Delete file          |
| GET    | `/api/uploads/:publicId/info` | Required | Get file info        |

**Middleware:**

- Multer with memory storage
- File type validation
- File size limits (10MB)
- Custom error handling

---

### 4. ✅ Route Integration

Updated `src/routes/index.ts` to include:

```typescript
import uploadsRouter from "./uploads.route";
router.use("/uploads", uploadsRouter);
```

---

## Folder Structure in Cloudinary

All files are organized in a structured hierarchy:

```
bcfi_hr/
├── applications/      # Application-related documents
├── valid_ids/         # ID verification documents
├── documents/         # General documents
├── profiles/          # User profile images
└── general/           # Miscellaneous files
```

**Naming Convention:**  
`YYYY-MM-DD_TIMESTAMP_originalfilename.ext`

Example: `2025-10-14_1728912345678_resume.pdf`

---

## Upload Types

| Type          | Folder                 | Resource Type | Use Case                |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- |
| `application` | `bcfi_hr/applications` | auto          | Application submissions |
| `id`          | `bcfi_hr/valid_ids`    | image         | ID verification         |
| `document`    | `bcfi_hr/documents`    | raw           | General documents       |
| `profile`     | `bcfi_hr/profiles`     | image         | Profile pictures        |
| `general`     | `bcfi_hr/general`      | auto          | Other files             |

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// Single File Upload
const file = document.querySelector("#fileInput").files[0];
const result = await uploadFile(file, "application");
console.log("Uploaded:", result.data.url);

// Multiple Files Upload
const files = Array.from(document.querySelector("#filesInput").files);
const result = await uploadMultipleFiles(files, "document");
console.log("Uploaded files:", result.data.files);

// Base64 Upload
const canvas = document.querySelector("#canvas");
const base64 = canvas.toDataURL("image/jpeg");
const result = await uploadBase64(base64, "profile");
console.log("Uploaded image:", result.data.url);

// Delete File
const publicId = "bcfi_hr/applications/2025-10-14_1728912345678_resume";
await deleteFile(publicId);
console.log("File deleted");
```

### Backend Integration

```typescript
import { uploadBuffer, deleteImage } from "../utils/cloudinary";

// In a controller
const buffer = req.file.buffer;
const result = await uploadBuffer(buffer, {
  folder: "bcfi_hr/applications",
  resource_type: "auto",
});

// Delete when application is rejected
await deleteImage(application.documentPublicId);
```

## Performance Considerations

### Sequential vs Parallel Uploads

**Current Implementation:** Sequential

- Prevents server overload
- Better error handling per file
- Predictable memory usage

**Future Consideration:** Parallel with limit

- Faster for multiple files
- Use Promise.allSettled with concurrency limit
- Monitor server resources

### Memory Management

- Using memory storage (not disk)
- Files processed as buffers
- Immediate upload to Cloudinary
- No local storage cleanup needed

### Timeout Management

- 60-second upload timeout
- 60-second Cloudinary timeout
- Prevents hanging requests
- Clear timeout error messages

---

## Security Features

1. **File Type Validation** ✅

   - MIME type checking
   - Extension validation
   - Prevents malicious uploads

2. **Size Limits** ✅

   - 10MB per file limit
   - Prevents DOS attacks
   - Server resource protection

3. **Authentication** ✅

   - JWT required for most endpoints
   - User context tracking
   - RBAC ready

4. **Public ID Encoding** ✅

   - URL encoding for deletion
   - Prevents path traversal
   - Safe file reference

5. **Error Message Sanitization** ✅
   - Production mode hides details
   - Development mode shows full errors
   - No sensitive data exposure

---

## Monitoring & Logging

Current logging includes:

- Upload attempts with folder and type
- Success confirmations
- Error details with context
- File deletion confirmations
- Failed file tracking in multiple uploads

**Recommended Additions:**

- Upload duration tracking
- File size statistics
- User upload patterns
- Error rate monitoring
- Cloudinary quota tracking

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**1. Upload Timeout**

- Check internet connection
- Verify file size < 10MB
- Check Cloudinary account limits

**2. Invalid File Type**

- Verify file extension
- Check MIME type
- Update allowed types if needed

**3. Authentication Error**

- Verify JWT token is valid
- Check token in Authorization header
- Ensure endpoint requires auth

**4. Cloudinary Upload Failed**

- Verify environment variables
- Check Cloudinary dashboard
- Verify account is active

**5. Files Not Appearing**

- Check folder path in Cloudinary
- Verify upload success response
- Check Cloudinary usage limits
